# blog-app-java
A full stack project build using Java as backend language, MySQL as the database and for frontend I have used bootstrap. This is a login based web application where user can login into the portal and post his blogs on a prdefined set of categories. The blogs can be liked in real time.  While creating this application MVC model is followed and standard setup has been followed.
